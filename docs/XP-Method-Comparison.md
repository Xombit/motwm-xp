# XP Award Method Comparison

## Official D&D 3.5e (DMG p.38-39) - "raw35" mode

**How it works:**
1. Calculate Encounter Level (EL) for all creatures combined
2. Each PC receives XP based on **their individual level vs that EL**
3. Higher-level PCs get less XP, lower-level PCs get more

**Example:** Party of Level 15 and Level 20 vs EL 19
- Level 15 PC: 18,000 XP
- Level 20 PC: 4,000 XP

**Key principle:** Each character is rewarded based on how challenging the encounter is *for them personally*.

## Official D&D 3.0e (DMG Table 7-1) - "split30" mode

**How it works:**
1. Calculate Average Party Level (APL)
2. Look up total XP pot for APL vs EL in table
3. Divide equally among all PCs

**Example:** Party of Level 15 and Level 20 (APL 18) vs EL 19
- Total pot: 14,400 XP
- Each PC: 7,200 XP

**Key principle:** The party shares credit equally regardless of individual levels.

## d20srd.org Calculator Method (Non-Standard)

**How it works:**
1. For each creature, calculate XP as if it were solo
2. Sum XP for all creatures
3. Divide total by number of PCs

**Example:** Party of Level 15 and Level 20 vs 7×CR14 + 1×CR16
- Level 15: (7×3000 + 6750) / 2 = 13,875 XP
- Level 20: (7×750 + 1500) / 2 = 3,375 XP

**Key principle:** Per-creature awards averaged across party.

**Note:** This method is not found in official 3.5e or 3.0e DMG rules. It appears to be a hybrid approach used by some online calculators.

- **3.5e (raw35):** Most accurate to 3.5e rules, rewards challenge appropriately per PC
- **3.0e (split30):** Simpler, ensures equal rewards, good for groups that prefer this
- **d20srd method:** Not currently implemented; can be added if requested by users
